* For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end and add "ayac". Examples: "code" becomes "odecayac" and "move" becomes "ovemayac."
* If the first consonants include "qu", move the "q" and the "u." Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first! Examples: "quick" becomes "ickquayac" while "squeal" becomes "quealsayac."
